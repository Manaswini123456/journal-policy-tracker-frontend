<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) is a non-profit, volunteer-run group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development and Open Science within the biological research community.

Our main activities are:

1. Running and supporting the BOSC conferences.
2. Organizing and supporting developer-centric "Hackathon" events.
3. Participating in the Google Summer of Code program on behalf of our member projects as an umbrella mentoring organization.
4. Managing servers, colocation facilities, bank account, domain names, and other assets for the benefit of our member projects.

## About The Project

Project description

The Journal Policy Tracker is your go-to place where you can find all the open-source journals and their policies. Currently the Frontend of this project is on React and React Bootstrap. This project aims to finalise the frontend after GSoC 2021, add state management and a user dashboard, and decouple the Frontend from CSS Frameworks for layout and presentation using Grid and Flex in place.

Tasks:
1. Study the existing user-interface for the journal policy tracker
2. Add functionality to the existing website while developing the components
3. Migrate the existing frontend CSS libraries to vanilla CSS
4. Work on the user-management dashboard
5. Use context/Redux for state management

Public opinion and policy statements about matters related to Open Source and Open Science in bioinformatics.
This is the frontend repository for the [Journal Policy Tracker](https://github.com/codeisscience/journal-policy-tracker-backend) web application.
